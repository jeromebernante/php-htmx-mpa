npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./public/css/tailwind-source.css -o ./public/css/tailwind-output.css --watch
php -S localhost:8000 -t public/


Step 8: Routing and Logout
Expand public/index.php to handle all paths:

Add cases for /user/dashboard, /user/deposit, etc., rendering the views.
For actions like /user/action (POST), include UserController.
Similarly for admin.
Logout: case '/logout': session_destroy(); header('Location: /login');

Step 9: Security and Enhancements

Add CSRF: Generate token in forms, verify in controllers.
Validation: Use filter_var for inputs.
Error handling: Use try-catch in controllers.
HTMX: Use for real-time updates, e.g., hx-get to refresh balance after actions.
Testing: Create an admin user manually in DB (set role='admin').
Deployment: Use a server with HTTPS; consider Docker for production.

Step 10: Running the App

Start PHP server: php -S localhost:8000 -t public/
Visit http://localhost:8000/register
Test flows: Register user, login, deposit (watch balance update via HTMX), transfer, etc.
For admin: Login as admin, manage users.

This is a basic, maintainable app. Expand with more features like pagination, logs, or better error UI. If you need code adjustments or additions, let me know!
